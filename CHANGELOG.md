- Context template engine producing `CLAUDE.md` + `.ai/` files for Claude Code and `.cursorrules` + `.cursor/rules/` for Cursor.
- `EngineeringRule` enum with predefined principles (Clean Code, SOLID, Fail Fast, Immutability First, etc.) injected into every generated file.
- Ollama readiness check on startup with a status badge on the Welcome screen and manual re-check (`r`) before proceeding.
- Architecture documentation describing Launchpad's components and data flow.
